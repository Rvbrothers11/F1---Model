# F1---Model
A 3D design of the F1 Logo, designed in Fusion
Since the age of 5, I have been a huge fan of Formula One. From watching cars zoom past me on television too even cycling on the track. I was fascinated by it all. However, too this date I had nothing tangible to show my love for motorsports. Yet, with an opportunity from blueprint and my skills in CAD modelling I was able to design this F1 Logo model to keep on my desk. My project is quick and easy to use. Just 3d Print the parts in the .step file, and by placing the f1 logo extension holders into its respective slots in the base you are able to create your very own F1 merch model.
